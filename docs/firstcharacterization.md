Internship Program Agent.
Characterization of the problem:
Please write down the characterization of the problem in the most accurate and
detailed way.
Our department has dozens of interns. Each intern must be assigned a personal
internship program of 72 months according to the syllabus detailed below. The
interns' internship programs appear in a huge table, at the top of the column in line
number 1 is the intern's name, and in the following rows appears his placement in the
various stations by month. The internship programs of all interns must be
synchronized so that each month there will be a defined number of interns at each
station. Make sure that each intern completes the entire syllabus, and on the other
hand, the number of interns at each station each month It will be appropriate.
Dependencies and Conditions:
Please write down the dependencies and conditions of the program and the stages
within it.

* Internship programs should not be changed from the current month onwards.
* It is forbidden to add or subtract stations to the intern, only to move the assignments of
that intern.
* Each station has a different color.
* Each intern at the beginning of the internship is assigned to the Department of Gynecology
A or the Department of Gynecology B. Therefore, there is HRP A andHRP B. The rest of the
rotations are shared by the two departments. Therefore, it is possible to create sub-models -
interns who belong to women A - their program will include HRP A and Gynecology A and
interns who belong to women B - their program will include HRP in Gynecology B. Each
given month the desired range of interns in each department A or B is as shown above.
* There are interns whose program will be more than 72 months, because there will be
maternity leave, sick leave - some of these do not extend the internship and some do (for
example, unpaid leave after maternity leave)* It should be strived that at the end of the
internship there will be 6 months of the department
- Always Stage A Before Stage B
- Phase A happens once a year - in June.
- Phase B happens twice a year – in November and March.
- Stage A should be between 3-4.5 years from the beginning of the internship (aspiring
as close to 3 years as possible)
- Stage 2 should be in the last year of the internship (preferably not really at the end,
but it is not possible to apply if there is more than a year left for the internship).
- In general, it is better that all the stations take place consecutively. Maternity
emergency station - it is advisable to split
- If there is no choice, it is possible to split the gynecology or HRP or delivery room
stations for 4 months and then another 2 months, here too it is highly not
recommended that it take place consecutively.
● Only a manager can add months of unpaid leave (maternity leave). The agent must
not change them.
● If a manager adds months of unpaid leave, up to six months of unpaid leave are
deducted from 14 months of leave (i.e., if the intern has 3 months of unpaid leave,
her internship program will remain with 72 months, but the department's months will
be reduced to 11). If more than 6 months of unpaid leave are added, the number of
months of internship increases according to the number of months added.
● Only a manager can add months of unpaid leave (unpaid leave). The agent must not
move them. If a manager adds months of unpaid leave - please ask the manager
whether these months of unpaid leave are counted to the internship or not, for each
month. If not, months must be added to the internship program accordingly.
- It is preferable for an intern to complete as many stations as possible that are
not a rotation or a department as soon as possible, and rotation stations and
a department should remain until the end – the person in charge of the
maternity emergency department should be after stage 1
