# Assets Folder

This folder contains static assets for the ResiPlanAI dashboard.

## Logo Setup

**To add the ResiPlanAI logo:**

1. Save the logo image as `logo.png` in this folder (`assets/logo.png`)
2. The dashboard will automatically detect and display it in:
   - The main header area (top of page)
   - The sidebar (for persistent branding)

## Supported Formats

- PNG (recommended for transparency)
- JPG/JPEG
- SVG

## File Location

Current expected path: `assets/logo.png`

If the logo file is not found, the dashboard will display a fallback text header instead.
